# Pushprom PHP client

This is a PHP client for [Pushprom](https://github.com/messagebird/pushprom). If you use Yii 2 you may want to have a look at the [Yii 2 client](https://github.com/messagebird/pushprom-yii-client).

This fork differes from the original by

1 Including an `include.php` file to include the required files without using Composer et al.
1 Using `array()` instead of `[]` to work with older PHP versions.

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/messagebird/pushprom-php-client/v/stable.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/messagebird/pushprom-php-client)
[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/messagebird/pushprom-php-client/license.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/messagebird/pushprom-php-client)
